This test is not about solving a particular problem. It's about execution and checking what's your default way of thinking and coding habits. This test is described quite vaguely on purpose, so interpretation of it's explicit and implicit requirements is up to you.

The task itself: prepare test automation script for Web-based application at https://promo.com for Sign Up, Login and select some video from library.

You have the freedom to choose language (like Python or Ruby) and framework (like pytest, Selenium, Geb, test-ng, RSpecs, Robot Framework or Cucumber).
